Greetings! ðŸ‘‹

{{< toc mobile_only=true is_open=true >}}

## OS recertification

Well, nothing surprising in principle, but I still canâ€™t understand whether recertification is like a retake (for which there is a commission) or not?

## I do labs on OS

Day and night, in the morning I get up and sit down, when I finish, I fall asleep. If only this would all end

## I'm doing an OS project

I donâ€™t even go to bed day and night, I hope Iâ€™ll make it to the university.
